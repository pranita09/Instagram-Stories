# Instagram Stories

## Build “Instagram Stories” feature

### Task

Develop a simplified version of the Instagram Stories feature. This application should allow users to view a series of “stories”—short, temporary posts that disappear after a set period (for the purposes of this assignment, the disappearance logic does not need to be implemented). The focus will be on the user interface and interaction, rather than backend logic or persistence.

### Features

- Build this only for mobile and not desktop.
- A list of stories (only images) should be visible in a smaller view in a horizontally scrollable list.
- Fetch the list of stories from an external file.
- User should be able to start viewing one of the available stories from list.
- The user should be able to manually navigate between stories using UI controls. Tapping on the left side of an open story should take the user to the previous story. Tapping on the right side of an open story should take the user to the next story.
- Stories should automatically advance to the next one after 5 seconds. The loading states should be handled properly.
- Do **not** use any external library for the core functionality.
- **Optional:** Use transitions for smoother story viewing.
